      Petroleum tanker trailers are transport trailers that are used to haul a variety of liquid hazmat loads. These
      loads include but are not limited to petroleum, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene and ethanol.
    </p>
    <p>
      These trailers have aluminum barrels and can have sub frames that are built out of either aluminum or steel
      depending on the transportation needs and weight restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They vary in size, but typically range between 9000 to 9500 gallons. In some states (such as Michigan, North
      Dakota, South Dakota, and others) the trailer sizes are larger (from 10,000 to 11,000 gallons), because of
      differing bridge law restrictions. In other states, A-Train or B-Train configurations allow carriers to use lead
      and pup trailers to maximize their hauling capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuel trailers are typically compartmentalized so that they can haul a variety of fuel products. This provides the
      carrier with flexibility in meeting the needs of its customers. Standard compartments range from 3 to 5
      compartments and typically have at least one double bulk heads between two of the compartments to reduce the risk
      of contamination between the compartments/products (normally to separate a diesel load from a normal gasoline
      load). These double bulk head compartments have “double walls” which is an additional security measure to protect
      against one of the compartment walls cracking or failing due to the pressure or breakdown which would otherwise
      containment the contents of both compartments.

      Tankmor’s fuel trailers can also be outfitted with additional equipment per our customers’ needs including (1) 3
      inch or 4 inch Pumps (used in some delivery services and in aviation fueling) (2) Scully Systems (used as an over
      fill protection for the tank) and (3) Vapor Recovery Systems (which are a safer, faster and cleaner way to load
      and unload the petroleum)
